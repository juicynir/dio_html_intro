                    Since I was a kid, kind of peculiar kid, I have been interested on education and technology.
                    Therefore, when I grew up, I start of my professional life as an English teacher. 
                    I got on language and worked in the field for while and then I decided to go to graduate school, 
                    where I am conducting a research based on Brazilian education statistics official data. Which has brought closed 
                    to coding and data science. At that point, I’ve started thinking about the cybersecurity area and what should I do to become a defender, 
                    thus I have been investing some of my free time exploring and learning what I can about this field, which is totally new to me, 
                    but still luring me to new adventures on the IT’s immense sea. Visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jucenirserafim/?locale=en_US"target="_blank">linkedin profile</a>.
